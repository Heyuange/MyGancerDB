# MyGancerDB
A spider to get the data of my cancer genome database.
You can just run it on your command line with: python3 mycancer.py

Attention please:

a.Note this script write with Python3.

b. This simple and stupid script will creat a urlfile first, this file contains all the variant url.

c. Then the script read the urlfile and get data.

d. Because of the limited ability of the writer(OK,me),this script will break several timesï¼Œthat obviously because of the rigths of network but i haven't slove it.

e. There are many questions so i don't advice anybody to use it.

f. This script will be better to use somedays later.
